# GenesorAnts
Code to reproduce metaheuristic algorithms for 2018 SIOP poster on scale shortening with Genes or Ants

## Project and Data Description
This repository includes R syntax for the 2018 SIOP poster: "Gens or Ants: Genes or Ants: Meta-heuristic algorithms for scale length optimization." 
The following aspects of the project can be accessed.

- Full submission in `'. item-level correlations (N = 62,997), descriptive statistics, and code for simulating a multivariate binary-item dataset in the `SimData-Syn.md` file.
- Simulated dataset of the 42-item Hogan Development Survey analog of the Dark Triad in `SimData.HDS.zip`
- R syntax for replicating network diagrams and analyses in `DarkNet.Syn`
- Full submission in `Dark Side Derailers as Causal Systems-2017 Poster.docx.` Item content removed to protect propietary key. 

## Requirements

- R > 3.0 (possibly earlier versions will work)

The following R packages should be installed and loaded to simulate the item-level data and run network analyses. 

```
install.packages("bindata")
install.packages("psych")
install.packages("qgraph")
install.packages("parcor")
```
